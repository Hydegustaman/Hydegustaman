About My project in this repo.

Actually, there are two project that I've write in this repo. First, the codes for # Bouncing Blue Sun #, and second are the codes for 3D (three dimension) animation. By mistake, I've end up putting both codes at the same repo. Apologize. You might wanna copy them to diffrent folder.

Have A Nice Day !!
